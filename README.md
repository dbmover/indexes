# Dbmover\Indexes
Abstract base plugin for migrating indexes. Vendors should use `VENDOR-indexes`
plugins instead.

## Installation
```sh
composer require dbmover/indexes
```

    Note: vendor-specific plugins for indexes will already require this package,
    so you shouldn't need to install it manually.

## Usage
See `dbmover/core` for general DbMover usage.

## Contributing
